# Home Cooked

## About the Project
This project was created as a take home assignment for a potential job as a junior software engineer. The requirements included, using React.js to build a simple web page (whatever you like to present) and then using Django to build at least two API endpoints for the frontend page you created to use. The second part of the assignment was to deploy the site to AWS. I used AWS S3 to deploy my frontend code and AWS EC2 to deploy the backend code.

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Django, and AWS

## Setup/Installation
You can view the live site at: _______
Additionally, you can clone this repo and `cd` into the directory.  
Once you are in the cloned directory, simply enter `npm start` and view the application within the browser of your choice.

## Approach
When I began this assignment, I knew that I could handle the frontend side efficiently and effectively, but the backend side with Django and deploying to AWS was going to be a learning experience working with both technologies. However, I was excited to take on the challenge and learn throughout the process.
